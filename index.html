<h2>Meyer Lab at UCLA</h2>

<p>We pair experiments with data-driven modeling to learn about cancer biology and innate immune signaling. This combination is necessary and synergistic: models in systems biology are only as good as the information used to assemble them. As our understanding of biology begins to assemble from information about single proteins, we need quantitative models to understand and even communicate these complex processes.</p>

<h3>Opportunities</h3>

<ul>
<li><i>Graduate Students:</i> There are typically 1â€“2 openings for graduate students each year. Candidates should <a href="https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/graduate-admissions/">apply to the Bioengineering Department</a> and specify interest in working in the Meyer lab in their application.</li>
<li><i>Postdoctoral Associates:</i> We are accepting postdoctoral researcher applications in multiple areas within the scope of the lab's overall focus. Applicants should hold a Ph.D. degree in bioengineering, chemical engineering, computational biology, or a related quantitative biological sciences field. Applicants should send a cover letter, CV, and references list as a single document to Dr. Meyer.</li>
</ul>
