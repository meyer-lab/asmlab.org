<h2> Systems biology: Building better models </h2>

<p>We pair experiments with data-driven modeling to learn about cancer biology and innate immune signaling. This combination is necessary and synergistic: models in systems biology are only as good as the information used to assemble them, and as our understanding of biology begins to assemble from information about single proteins, we need quantitative models to understand and even communicate these complex processes.</p>
