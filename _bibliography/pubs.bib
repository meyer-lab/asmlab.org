  abstract	= { Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a leading cause of health expenditures, in part due to
		  the expensive and lengthy diagnostic method that involves culturing bacteria. A new
		  technique has been developed allowing for faster UTI diagnosis through an electrochemical
		  chip to measure unique ribosomal RNA (rRNA) found in bacteria associated with UTIs. Although
		  this technique has had success, concentrating the bacterial rRNA through the use of
		  two-phase aqueous micellar systems in the urine sample prior to utilizing the chip may
		  provide increased sensitivity. This approach is appealing because these systems are
		  relatively inexpensive, easily scalable, and simple to use. In this study, we examined the
		  partitioning behavior of bacterial RNA fragments, puri ed from Enteroccocus faecalis, in a
		  two-phase micellar system comprised of the nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 and
		  phosphate-buffered saline. Experimentally measured results were compared to theoretical
		  values to determine the governing factors involved in RNA partitioning. We demonstrated that
		  RNA fragments partition primarily due to steric, excluded-volume interactions that exist
		  between the RNA and micelles. However, the presence of entrained micelle-poor, RNA-rich
		  domains in the macroscopic micelle-rich, RNA-poor phase limits the extent of RNA
		  partitioning in this system. Additionally, by manipulating the volume ratio, or the volume
		  of the top, micelle-poor phase divided by that of the bottom, micelle-rich phase, we
		  demonstrated that RNA fragments can be concentrated up to four-fold in a predictive manner.
		  Concentrating the bacterial RNA with these two-phase micellar systems prior to detection

  abstract	= { Metastases are a major cause of cancer mortality. AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
		  aberrantly expressed in many tumors, is a potent oncogenic driver of metastatic cell
		  motility and has been identified as broadly relevant in cancer drug resistance. Despite its
		  frequent association with changes in cancer phenotypes, the precise mechanism leading to AXL
		  activation is incompletely understood. In addition to its ligand growth arrest specific-6
		  (Gas6), activation of AXL requires the lipid moiety phosphatidylserine (PS). PS is only
		  available to mediate AXL activation when it is externalized on cell membranes, an event that
		  occurs during certain physiologic processes such as apoptosis. Here it is reported that
		  exposure of cancer cells to PS-containing vesicles, including synthetic liposomes and
		  apoptotic bodies, contributes to enhanced migration of tumor cells via a PS-Gas6-AXL
		  signaling axis. These findings suggest that anti-cancer treatments that induce fractional
		  cell killing enhance the motility of surviving cells in AXL-expressing tumors, which may
		  explain the widespread role of AXL in limiting therapeutic efficacy. Implications: This
		  study demonstrates that motility behavior of AXL-expressing tumor cells can be elicited by
		  Gas6-bearing apoptotic bodies generated from tumor treatment with therapeutics that produce
		  killing of a portion of the tumor cells present but not all, hence generating potentially
		  problematic invasive and metastatic behavior of the surviving tumor cells. },

  abstract	= { Traditional drug screening methods lack features of the tumor microenvironment that can
		  contribute to resistance. There remains a gap in whether extracellular signals, such as
		  stiffness, dimensionality, and cell-cell contacts act independently, or are integrated
		  within a cell, to affect drug sensitizations or resistance. This is critically important, as
		  adaptive resistance is mediated, at least in part, by the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the
		  tumor microenvironment. We developed an approach to screen drug responses in cells cultured
		  on 2D and in 3D biomaterial environments to explore how key features of ECM mediate drug
		  response. This approach uncovered that cells on 2D hydrogels and as spheroids encapsulated
		  in 3D hydrogels were less responsive to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-targeting drugs
		  sorafenib and lapatinib, but not cytotoxic drugs, compared to single cells in hydrogels and
		  cells on plastic. Transcriptomic differences between these in vitro models and tumor
		  xenografts did not reveal mechanisms of ECM-mediated resistance. However, a systems biology
		  analysis of phospho-kinome data suggested that MEK phosphorylation was associated with
		  RTK-targeted drug resistance. Using sorafenib as a model drug, we found that
		  co-administration with a MEK inhibitor decreased ECM-mediated resistance in vitro and
		  reduced in vivo tumor burden compared to sorafenib alone. In sum, we provide a novel
		  strategy for identifying and overcoming ECM-mediated resistance mechanisms by performing

		  In contrast, the related dengue virus (DENV) does not elicit teratogenicity. To model viral
		  interaction with cells of the fetal CNS in vitro, we investigated the tropism of ZIKV and
		  DENV for different induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells, with a particular
		  focus on microglia-like cells. We show that ZIKV infected isogenic neural progenitors,
		  astrocytes, and microglia-like cells (pMGLs), but was only cytotoxic to neural progenitors.
		  Infected glial cells propagated ZIKV and maintained ZIKV load over time, leading to viral
		  spread to susceptible cells. DENV triggered stronger immune responses and could be cleared
		  by neural and glial cells more efficiently. pMGLs, when cocultured with neural spheroids,
		  invaded the tissue and, when infected with ZIKV, initiated neural infection. Since microglia

  abstract	= { To better understand the signaling complexity of AXL, a member of the TAM receptor
		  tyrosine kinase family, we created a physical and functional map of AXL signaling
		  interactions, phosphorylation events, and target-engagement of three AXL tyrosine kinase
		  inhibitors (TKI). We assessed AXL protein-complexes using BioID, effects of AXL TKI on
		  global phosphoproteins using mass spectrometry, and target engagement of AXL TKI using
		  activity-based protein profiling. BioID identifies AXL-interacting proteins that are mostly
		  involved in cell adhesion/migration. Global phosphoproteomics show that AXL inhibition
		  decreases phosphorylation of peptides involved in phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling
		  and cell adhesion/migration. Comparison of three AXL inhibitors reveals that TKI RXDX-106
		  inhibits pAXL, pAKT and migration/invasion of these cells without reducing their viability,
		  while Bemcentinib exerts AXL-independent phenotypic effects on viability. Proteomic
		  characterization of these TKIs demonstrates that they inhibit diverse targets in addition to
		  AXL, with Bemcentinib having the most off-targets. AXL and EGFR TKI co-treatment did not
		  reverse resistance in cell line models of Erlotinib-resistance. However, a unique
		  vulnerability was identified in one resistant clone, wherein combination of Bemcentinib and
		  Erlotinib inhibited cell viability and signaling. We also show that AXL is overexpressed in
		  ~30-40% of non-small but rarely in small-cell lung cancer. Cell lines have a wide range of
		  AXL expression, with basal activation detected rarely. }

		  Extensive characterization of these interactions has revealed how the inclusion of certain

		  Current therapies are insufficient at killing dormant cells; thus, they can remain quiescent
		  in the body for decades until eventually undergoing a phenotypic switch, resulting in
		  metastases that are more adaptable and drug resistant. Unfortunately, dormancy has few in

		  One such RTK is AXL whose overexpression, frequently observed in bypass resistant tumors,
		  drives both cell survival and associated malignant phenotypes such as
		  epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition and migration. However, the signaling molecules
		  and pathways eliciting these responses have remained elusive. To explore these coordinated

		  multivariate modeling, we mapped signaling perturbations to specific resistant phenotypes.
		  Our results suggest that AXL signaling can be summarized into two clusters associated with
		  progressive disease and poor clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients. These clusters
		  displayed favorable Abl1 and SFK motifs and their phosphorylation was consistently decreased

		  the SFK cluster through FAK1 which is known to complex with Src. Moreover, the SFK cluster
		  overlapped with a previously established focal adhesion kinase (FAK1) signature conferring
		  EMT-mediated erlotinib resistance in lung cancer cells. Finally, we show that downstream of

  abstract	= {Recent biological studies have been revolutionized in scale and granularity by multiplex and high-throughput assays. Profiling cell responses across several experimental parameters, such as perturbations, time, and genetic contexts, leads to richer and more generalizable findings. However, these multidimensional datasets necessitate a reevaluation of the conventional methods for their representation and analysis. Traditionally, experimental parameters are merged to flatten the data into a two-dimensional matrix, sacrificing crucial experiment context reflected by the structure. As Marshall McLuhan famously stated, “the medium is the message.” In this work, we propose that the experiment structure is the medium in which subsequent analysis is performed, and the optimal choice of data representation must reflect the experiment structure. We review how tensor-structured analyses and decompositions can preserve this information. We contend that tensor methods are poised to become integral to the biomedical data sciences toolkit.},

  abstract	= {Tensor factorization is a dimensionality reduction method applied to multidimensional arrays. These methods are useful for identifying patterns within a variety of biomedical datasets due to their ability to preserve the organizational structure of experiments and therefore aid in generating meaningful insights.  However, missing data in the datasets being analyzed can impose challenges. Tensor factorization can be performed with some level of missing data and reconstruct a complete tensor. However, while tensor methods may impute these missing values, the choice of fitting algorithm may influence the fidelity of these imputations. Previous approaches, based on alternating least squares with prefilled values or direct optimization, suffer from introduced bias or slow computational performance. In this study, we propose that censored least squares can better handle missing values with data structured in tensor form. We ran censored least squares on four different biological datasets and compared its performance against alternating least squares with prefilled values and direct optimization. We used the error of imputation and the ability to infer masked values to benchmark their missing data performance. Censored least squares appeared best suited for the analysis of high-dimensional biological data by accuracy and convergence metrics across several studies.},

  abstract	= {Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody Fc species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties and then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which Fc properties can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data.},

  abstract	= {Effective tools for exploration and analysis are needed to extract insights from large-scale single-cell measurement data. However, current techniques for handling single-cell studies performed across experimental conditions (e.g., samples, perturbations, or patients) require restrictive assumptions, lack flexibility, or do not adequately deconvolute condition-to-condition variation from cell-to-cell variation. Here, we report that the tensor decomposition method PARAFAC2 (Pf2) enables the dimensionality reduction of single-cell data across conditions. We demonstrate these benefits across two distinct contexts of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments of peripheral immune cells: pharmacologic drug perturbations and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient samples. By isolating relevant gene modules across cells and conditions, Pf2 enables straightforward associations of gene variation patterns across specific patients or perturbations while connecting each coordinated change to certain cells without pre-defining cell types. The theoretical grounding of Pf2 suggests a unified framework for many modeling tasks associated with single-cell data. Thus, Pf2 provides an intuitive universal dimensionality reduction approach for multi-sample single-cell studies across diverse biological contexts.},

The neurotransmitter serotonin epitomizes an analyte that is challenging to detect in situ due to low concentrations and co-existing similarly structured analytes and interferents. We developed rapid-pulse voltammetry for brain neurotransmitter monitoring due to the high information content in non-background-subtracted faradaic and non-faradic current responses at each pulse step. Here, we illustrate how Bayesian optimization can be used to hone searches for optimized rapid pulse waveforms in prohibitively large combinatorial spaces. Our machine-learning-guided workflow outperformed random and human-guided waveform designs and is tunable a priori to enable selective analyte detection. We interpreted the black box optimizer to gain insights into the logic of machine-learning-guided waveform design. Our approach is straightforward and generalizable for a variety of single and multi-analyte problems requiring optimized electrochemical waveform solutions.},
