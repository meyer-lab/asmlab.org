### Identifying Shared Features Among Resistance Mechanisms to Help Predict Effective Combination Therapies for Individual Patients

Targeted therapies extend many cancer patient's lives, but are limited in efficacy to a subset of patients and by the development of resistance. Enormous efforts undertaken to identify mechanisms of resistance have uncovered numerous changes involving gene expression, post-translational regulation, and even tumor-extrinsic factors such as host-derived growth factors. Combination therapy can effectively combat resistance, but requires accurate identification of the relevant resistance mechanism. Precision therapy must account for many genetic and non-genetic intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms if it will accurately select these combinations.

> In RTK-driven tumors, signals are transduced from the receptor to various kinases. Upon blocking the original cancer driver, resistance can be conferred by an untargeted receptor. Some receptors, however, do not provide essential resistance signals. By identifying similarities and differences of signaling from each receptor, we will be able to identify measurements pinpointing the relevant receptor causing resistance.

### Systems Approaches for Rational Immune Therapies

Many immune receptors operate as families with multiple ligands and receptors, expressed across diverse cell populations. The lab's efforts operate around the central hypothesis that the multiple members of these families are present to perform computation-like regulation across cell populations. Further, we can use engineering analysis tools to measure and manipulate these systems. We are studying regulation of families like the Tyro3, AXL, MerTK (TAM) tyrosine kinases, Fc gamma, and common gamma chain cytokine receptors. Each is a target of existing or potential therapies which necessarily have pleiotropic effects due to family structure. Therefore, these efforts will be critical to effectively targeting these families therapeutically. Indeed, I plan for my lab to demonstrate these efforts' translational potential by engineering new therapies in cancer.

> In many cancers, a subset of tumor cells overexpress AXL, making them invasive and resistant to therapy. TAM receptor activation within dendritic cells potently inhibits the innate immune response. T cell release of ProS further dampens the immune response. Activation of TAMs inhibits NK cell-mediated lysis. Each of these cell populations express distinct and dynamic combinations of TAM receptor, likely modulating functional changes in microenvironmental response.
