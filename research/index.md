The Meyer lab focuses on the interface of integrating data-driven and mechanistic computational approaches with detailed cell biological experiments to understand molecular systems. We apply both methods in concert, as understanding the limitations of both the computational and experimental methods is essential to their integration.

### Engineering TAM RTK targeted therapies and immunotherapies

TAM receptors are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), represented by AXL, Tyro3, and MerTK, which have attracted considerable interest in the past decade as potential therapeutic targets in a wide range of cancers. While these receptors have been identified using genetic interventions as having important roles in cancer cell therapeutic resistance, immune cell-mediated clearance and metastasis, very little is understood about post-translational regulation of the receptors.

> In many cancers, a subset of tumor cells overexpress AXL, making them invasive and resistant to therapy. TAM receptor activation within dendritic cells potently inhibits the innate immune response. Macrophages and NK cells also express a complement of TAM receptors, which further influence the tumor immune response. Tumor cell AXL expression may also influence other PtdSer receptor activation within the tumor microenvironment.

Therapeutic targeting of the TAM receptors was initially motivated in part by relatively mild effects upon knocking out expression. Further study has uncovered important function of the receptors in diverse processes and cautions against overly broad therapeutic targeting, but it suggests promise for TAM-targeted cancer therapy. Indeed, ablation of AXL and MerTK increases susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis on one hand, while having potent tumor-extrinsic anti-metastatic effects on the other.

For these reasons, TAM receptor targeting represents a uniquely interesting context to investigate how we might develop fundamentally new approaches to cancer therapy and to use engineering methods to accelerate reverse-engineering molecular systems. These receptors highlight the etiological importance of rare cells to tumor progression, since their preliminary effectiveness has been specific to metastasis. At the same time, the importance of host signaling will limit design of therapies but also presents new possibilities for modulating immune response which may not suffer from the characteristic acquired resistance limitations of previous targeted therapies.

### Targeted therapy resistance

Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-targeted therapies have been applied successfully in cancer treatment, though with limited effectiveness as activity of non-targeted RTKs can enable cells to become resistant. While redundant signaling is now appreciated as a common mechanism of acquired and innate resistance, exactly what signaling is essential to resistance and whether it is conserved or varies across cancer contexts has not been addressed. RTKs lead to a common set of downstream signals, but in vastly different quantitative combinations, and differ in their ability to confer resistance in a context-dependent manner. A fundamental, rigorous understanding of resistance is necessary if we are to develop better therapies to overcome this redundancy.

> RTKs lead to the same set of downstream signals, but shifts in the quantitative amount of each lead to context-dependence resistance development.

Thus, we plan to develop techniques to measure RTK-adapter interaction quantitatively and across the multiple potential interactions within a cell simultaneously with the intention of completely capturing signaling from these receptors. We will use these techniques combined with quantitative modeling to examine interactions during receptor activation to understand how different RTKs can provide redundant signaling leading to RTK-targeted cancer therapy resistance.

### Improving model parameterization and understanding in systems biology

Models in systems biology are frequently evaluated by their overall predictive ability but are then interpreted on a component-by-component basis. This can lead to spurious conclusions when experimental and model uncertainty is not taken into account. We aim to borrow methods from other fields in which model uncertainty is handled more rigorously to improve the process of model decomposition and interpretation.
