title: Research Summary

Our lab integrates experimental and computational strategies to measure, model, and therapeutically manipulate cell-to-cell communication, with applications in the development of immune and cancer therapies.

Our work is built on the principle that cells communicate through genetically-defined pathways. A deep understanding of these pathways allows us to engineer interventions that drive desired cellular behaviors or resolve pathological dysfunction. To achieve this, our lab combines a "bottom-up," mechanistic approach with a "top-down," integrative perspective. Our bottom-up strategy uses mechanistic models of binding and signaling processes to predict and optimize therapeutically useful cell communication. In parallel, our top-down strategy leverages the observation that cellular circuits create coordinated activity across cells, tissues, and individuals. We develop and apply new data analysis techniques to uncover the structure and emergent function of these pathways from this systems-level view. These two approaches are synergistic: a mechanistic understanding is necessary to engineer pathway function, while the top-down view provides critical insights from their natural context.

We currently focus this integrated approach on the immune system, specifically on the mechanisms of selective cytokine and antibody Fc signaling. We investigate the structural principles that enable selective signal delivery, retention within the tissue microenvironment, and signal processing at the cell surface. We are also developing techniques for the integrative analysis of single-cell observations to link coordinated cellular changes with tissue- and patient-level outcomes.
