Working with UCLA's Institute for Commercialization & Industry Collaboration, our lab offers specialized skills to external parties through a fee-for-service model with greater flexibility as compared to traditional grant mechanisms.

### Multivalent Binding Modeling for Optimizing Therapeutic Designs

<img src="binding.svg" width="90%" />

Our lab provides advanced multivalent binding modeling services to optimize the design of multi-specific immunotherapeutic agents. Using a flexible framework (detailed in [relevant publications](binding.html)), we accurately model complex agent-target cell interactions, quantitatively characterize receptor engagement dynamics, and predict therapeutic windows. We analyze key design parameters to understand their impact on therapeutic activity and potential toxicity. Our services range from data fitting and analysis of _in vitro_ assays to modeling immune cell interactions _in vivo_. We can deliver comprehensive reports on parameter contributions and provide custom software for analysis reproduction. Working closely with clients from startups to large pharmaceutical organizations, either via grants or work-for-hire, we provide actionable insights to accelerate drug development and improve candidate selection.

### Tensor Modeling and Big Data Exploration

Our lab specializes in applying innovative tensor-based approaches to analyze complex, multidimensional biological datasets where traditional matrix methods fall short. By leveraging tensor decomposition, we help researchers extract meaningful patterns, preserving the inherent data structure and relationships often lost in simpler models. These techniques offer increased statistical power, uncover higher-order interactions, and provide interpretable dimensionality reduction, all while robustly handling the sparse, noisy, or incomplete data common in biological studies. We work collaboratively with clients, providing accessible software tools, comprehensive documentation, and expert consultation.
