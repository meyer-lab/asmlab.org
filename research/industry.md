#### Multivalent Binding Modeling for Therapeutic Design Optimization

Our lab offers advanced multivalent binding modeling services to help biotechnology companies optimize the design of multi-specific immunotherapeutic agents. Using a flexible multivalent binding framework (relevant publications), we can:

- Accurately model complex interactions between multi-specific agents and target cells
- Quantitatively characterize receptor engagement dynamics
- Predict therapeutic windows for various designs
- Analyze the impact of key design parameters on therapeutic activity and potential toxicity

Our services include:

- Data fitting and analysis of in vitro assay results
- Modeling of immune cell interactions in the presence and absence of tumor cells
- Comprehensive reports on parameter contributions to predicted outcomes
- Custom software for reproducing analyses

We work closely with clients to address specific scientific questions and provide actionable insights for therapeutic design optimization. We have worked with several organizations, from early startups to large pharmaceutical organizations, both as a grant or work for hire. Our expertise can help accelerate your drug development process and improve candidate selection.
