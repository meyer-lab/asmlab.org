B.A., M.S. Biology, Saint Anselm College, Tulane University  

Ted has joined the team as a postdoctoral associate. The focus of his previous research has aimed at characterizing the function of noncoding RNAs in breast cancer EMT and metastasis. This experience led to an appreciation that cancer is a systems-level disease. Currently, his research focuses on the dynamic relationship between TAM receptors at the tumor-immune interface, and developing targeted therapies in this context. Outside the lab, his research is directed at all aspects of ice hockey and music.

### Catera Wilder, Postdoctoral Associate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cwilder1@ucla.edu"><svg class="svg-icon"><use xlink:href="#fa-envelope"></use></svg></a>      
Ph.D., Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Tech and Emory University   
B.S., Biological Engineering, University of Missouri  

Catera Wilder is a postdoctoral scholar who joined the Meyer group working on a collaborative project studying the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, a key pathway that regulates the innate immune response. Her interest lies in understanding regulatory mechanisms of two IFN families (i.e. type I and III IFNs) that elicit differential physiological functions and expression of interferon-stimulated genes. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with friends over a good meal and catching up on her favorite TV shows.

### Marc Creixell, Graduate Student&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mcreixell"><svg class="svg-icon"><use xlink:href="#fa-github"></use></svg></a>  <a href="mailto:creixell@g.ucla.edu"><svg class="svg-icon"><use xlink:href="#fa-envelope"></use></svg></a>      
M.S., Biomedical Sciences, Imperial College London   
B.S., Biotechnology, University of Barcelona  

Marc is a Ph.D. student in Bioengineering. While a visiting masterâ€™s student in the [Yaffe lab](https://yaffelab.mit.edu) at MIT, Marc studied novel functional sites in protein kinases and how cancer mutations perturb these sites in many of them to contribute to malignancy and drug resistance. His interest lies in kinase biology, cellular signal integration, and cancer precision medicine. Outside the lab, Marc enjoys running, nature, and traveling.

Brian is a Ph.D. student who joined the lab during Summer 2019. Brian completed his B.S. in Bioengineering at UCLA, where he conducted research as a member of the [Kasko group](http://kaskolab.com). Brian's research interests include computational analysis of cellular signaling pathways and their processing dynamics, as well as the utility of these models in the process of drug discovery. His interests outside of the lab include playing soccer, lifting weights, and watching cooking shows.
