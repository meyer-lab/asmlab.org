### Song Yi Bae, Postdoctoral Associate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sybae@mit.edu"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a>      
Ph.D., College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University    
B.S., College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans University

As a graduate Song Yi focused on identifying biomarkers and mechanisms of acquired EGFR-TKI resistance in non-small cell lung cancer. The TAM receptor AXL being one of her interest in previous work, she joined the team as a postdoc to further explore the role of AXL in drug resistance. She is currently enthusiastic to study the crosstalk between AXL and other RTKs, and search effective strategies to overcome drug resistance. After work, she likes to relax while listening to the radio.

### Edward Richards, Postdoctoral Associate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:erichard@mit.edu"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a>      
Ph. D., Cancer Biology, Moffitt Cancer Center at University of South Florida   
B.A., M.S. Biology, Saint Anselm College, Tulane University  

Ted has joined the team as a postdoctoral associate. The focus of his previous research has aimed at characterizing the function of noncoding RNAs in breast cancer EMT and metastasis. This experience led to an appreciation that cancer is a systems-level disease. Currently, his research focuses on the dynamic relationship between TAM receptors at the tumor-immune interface, and developing targeted therapies in this context. Outside the lab, his research is directed at all aspects of ice hockey and music.
