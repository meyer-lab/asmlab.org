### Catera Wilder, Postdoctoral Associate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cwilder1@ucla.edu"><svg class="svg-icon"><use xlink:href="#fa-envelope"></use></svg></a>      
Ph.D., Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Tech and Emory University   
B.S., Biological Engineering, University of Missouri  

Catera Wilder is a postdoctoral scholar who joined the Meyer group working on a collaborative project studying the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, a key pathway that regulates the innate immune response. Her interest lies in understanding regulatory mechanisms of two IFN families (i.e. type I and III IFNs) that elicit differential physiological functions and expression of interferon-stimulated genes. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with friends over a good meal and catching up on her favorite TV shows.
