# Mission Statement
Welcome to the Meyer Lab! The Meyer lab has three central goals:
-	To do quality science
-	To develop each lab member to become a successful scientist
-	To maintain a collegial and intellectually-stimulating environment

# What I expect from you
You will help the lab to make progress in research
-	Communicate regularly with the various lab members to see who needs help with their project.
-	Begin reading the scientific literature - read the papers I suggest, run a literature search and read papers suggested by this search. Literature searches can be done in PubMed (best for looking for a specific author/combination of keywords), Google Scholar (best for looking for the ‘top’ papers on a topic), or Google (really useful for finding specific factoids).
-	Learn how to plan your experiments.  Make sure your experiments address the question of interest correctly – this includes learning how to do the appropriate controls, techniques, etc. ‘At the Bench’ Chapters 1-6 provide general advice on how to set up your lab space/desk space, keeping a notebook and planning experiments, while Chapters 7-10 provide useful technical background for many of our lab’s main assays. Additionally, Wikipedia or company websites are often great sources of information on how an assay works.You will also need to learn how to effectively plan and multi-task to prevent down times. Develop plans with short/medium/long-term goals.
-	Keep detailed lab notebooks – these are essential to turn your hard work into a finished paper. Your notes should allow your work to be reproduced (meaning they must be understandable by people other than yourself) and will help to assign credit for authorship.  They are required by funding agencies and for any potential patents.  At a minimum each experiment should clearly identify the date, purpose, what you did, the results, and your conclusions. Your bound notebook should establish links to electronic files (such as images) and to print-outs of raw data that are kept in 3-ring binders (such as flow cytometry plots or multi-well plate reader assays). You are required to leave the originals behind when you leave the lab for others to build upon your work. More details can be found in the slides about notebooks.


# You will help to manage the lab
-	You will be responsible for
  -	Overseeing that shared jobs are done
  -	All aspects of lab safety (chemical, biological, bloodborne pathogens)
  -	Ordering and inventory
    -	Regularly check stocks and keep lab supplies organized
    -	Maintain electronic inventories (chem and supply)
    -	Place weekly MDS and credit card orders
  -	Making sure that protocols are kept up to date
  -	Scheduling equipment maintenance (together with the graduate student/post doc who is in charge of that equipment)
  -	Reporting anything to me that needs my attention (lab conflict, equipment problem, etc)
-	As a research specialist, it is expected that you will take a leading role in training new lab personnel – to many people, you will be the ‘go to’ person to field questions. If you are not the best person to help with a particular question, please help them find the right person in the lab.

# You will be a good lab citizen
-	Data belongs to the lab, not to any one individual – as a result, you will be expected to leave your original notebooks and files when you leave the lab.  In addition, there will be times when you will be asked to assist me in submitting grant applications to NIH/NSF/etc. This activity is essential to provide continuing support for the lab.
-	You will work safely in the lab.  Before beginning in the lab you must complete safety training.
-	You will keep lab protocols up-to-date on the main lab computer.
-	When working in the labs of other investigators, be polite, neat, and gracious.  Always follow their rules. If something breaks during your use, report it immediately to the appropriate person.
-	Be respectful, tolerant of, and work collegially with laboratory colleagues:  respect individual differences in values, personalities, and work styles.  

# What you can expect from me
-	I will set the scientific direction for the lab and provide the means to pursue those directions.  This will include helping lab members define their research topics, writing grants to fund the research, and maintaining the necessary university protocols for us to utilize the laboratory. Additionally, I will seek out collaborators for our work to further your opportunities.
-	I will be available for regular meetings and will provide timely review of research.  In addition, I will do my best to provide an open door policy and respond quickly to e-mails.  Please be aware that there will be times when I will be unavailable due to other obligations – in particular my teaching is on the engineering campus. For abstracts and small data questions, I will generally be able to review in 1-2 days, for papers and thesis, I will need 1-2 weeks.
-	I will provide a work environment that is intellectually stimulating, supportive, safe, and free from harassment. I take seriously any difficulties you experience in relationship to this statement – if there are conflicts with another lab member, please inform me and I will work with you and the other lab member to find a resolution. I will strive to understand your unique situation and am open to your suggestions on how to improve your experience in the lab.

# Nuts and Bolts
## Hours and Vacation
Your position has an expectation of 40 hours/week. I am willing to grant some flexibility here, but I do require that:
-	You are available during the core lab hours of 9-3 each day (and alert me at least 24 hours in advance if you will be missing some of these hours)
-	You set your remaining hours in a way that works with the lab experiments you are doing
-	You keep track of your leave time in accordance with the UW-Madison HR rules

## Meetings
You will meet with me and the various graduate students/post-docs that you are working with. Come prepared to discuss/present your recent research and next steps.  A written agenda including what you have done and what you propose to do in the next week must be e-mailed to me by 3 pm the day before the meeting. You must bring your lab notebook to each meeting. Group meetings will rotate between a variety of formats:  research updates, research presentations, and journal clubs. Attendance is mandatory – active participation is essential!

## Annual Evaluations
Each year we will have an evaluation – this will help us to determine things that are going well or are areas for improvement. I will tell you if I am satisfied with your progress and help identify steps you can take to fix any concerns. This is also an opportunity for you to communicate to me what I can do to help you succeed. Tell me if you feel that you need more guidance, more independence, to meet more often, etc.


## Authorship
One of the most important tasks in science is disseminating your research through publications and presentations; therefore, authorship on these items is an important indicator to the outside world of your role. Authorship implies a significant contribution to a paper such as intellectual ideas that change the research or experimental contributions (just following instructions and not actively participating in the experimental design/interpretation will be acknowledged, but likely would not result in an authorship). While the order of authors varies by specific field, in general for bioengineering the first author is the student/post-doc who took the lead and wrote the paper, the last author is the PI, and the authors in between are in order of decreasing contribution. Failure to complete papers before leaving the lab may result in a junior member doing so as the 1st author in your place.
