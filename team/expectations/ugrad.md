title: Undergraduate Student Expectations
---

This complements the [common](common.html) and other guidelines. Suggestions and input are welcome.

As an undergraduate researcher in this lab, you will typically be paired with a senior lab mentor. This is a great time to learn how research is done. Please take advantage of this time!

## What I expect from you

### You will take ownership of your educational experience

- Early on we will discuss your personal and program goals for your experience. You will need to know what you are required to do for your research credits (papers, presentations, etc) and you are responsible for making this happen on time. If there are elements where you need feedback from me or your graduate mentor, please involve us early!
- My approach to grades for undergraduates is to base them on your professionalism and effort—see below for specific expectations. I have no problem giving everyone an A, but an A is not guaranteed.

### You will maintain a professional attitude and work to improve your research skills

- Establish and maintain a regular research schedule. Be on time for all meetings (with your mentor, me, or the entire group).
- While class should always be a priority, make sure you find regular time for research. One of the most important skills in life is balancing multiple demands, and this takes practice to develop.
- Begin reading the scientific literature - read the papers your mentor or I suggest, and use these to branch out into others we haven't mentioned. The lab website provides a collection of some papers broadly relevant to the mission of the lab. Also attend relevant seminars – these will teach you not only science, but how scientists present their work.
- Learn how to plan your experiments so that they help you progress on the overall goal of your project. Make sure your experiments address the question of interest correctly. This includes learning how to do the appropriate controls, techniques, etc.
- Learn how to accept and utilize constructive criticism. This feedback is intended to improve your work and is part of the scientific training process.
