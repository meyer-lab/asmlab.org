As an undergraduate researcher in this lab, you will typically be paired with a senior lab ‘mentor’ and will work on a component of their project. This is a great time to learn how research is done and get a sense for what life would be like if you choose a career in research through medical or graduate schools.  Please take advantage of this time!

# What I expect from you
## You will take ownership of your educational experience
-	Early on we will discuss your personal and program goals for your experience.  You will need to know what you are required to do for your research credits (papers, presentations, etc) and you are responsible for making this happen on time. If there are elements where you need feedback from me or your graduate mentor, please involve us early!
-	My approach to grades for undergraduates is to base them on your professionalism and effort – see below for specific expectations.  I have no problem giving everyone an A, but an A is not guaranteed.

## You will maintain a professional attitude and work to improve your research skills
-	Establish and maintain a regular research schedule.  Be on time for all meetings (with your mentor, me, or the entire group).
-	While you can adjust your hours to accommodate deadlines in other classes occasionally, make your research time a priority. One of the most important skills in life is balancing multiple demands, and this takes practice to develop.
-	Keep detailed lab notebooks – these are essential to turn your hard work into a finished paper. Your notes should allow your work to be reproduced (meaning they must be understandable by people other than yourself) and will help to assign credit for authorship. They are required by funding agencies and for any potential patents. At a minimum each experiment should clearly identify the date, the purpose, what you did (including anything that didn’t go well), the results, and your conclusions. Your bound notebook should establish links to electronic files (such as images) and to print-outs of raw data that are kept in 3-ring binders (such as flow cytometry plots or multi-well plate reader assays). You are required to leave the originals behind when you leave the lab for others to build upon your work.
-	Begin reading the scientific literature - read the papers your mentor or I suggest, and use these to branch out into others we haven't mentioned. The lab website provides a collection of some papers broadly relevant to the mission of the lab. Also attend relevant seminars – these will teach you not only science, but how scientists present their work.
-	Learn how to plan your experiments so that they help you progress on the overall goal of your project.  Make sure your experiments address the question of interest correctly – this includes learning how to do the appropriate controls, techniques, etc.
-	Work safely in the lab.  Before beginning in the lab you must complete safety training. Be sure to label everything you work with in the lab so that others know what it is. When working in the labs of other investigators, be polite, neat, and gracious. Always follow their rules. If something breaks during your use, report it immediately to the appropriate person.
-	Learn how to accept and utilize constructive criticism. This feedback is intended to improve your work and is part of the scientific training process.
-	Be respectful, tolerant of, and work collegially with laboratory colleagues:  respect individual differences in values, personalities, and work styles.
