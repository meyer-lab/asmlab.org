# What I expect from you
You will help the lab to make progress in research
-	Communicate regularly with the various lab members to see who needs help with their project.
-	Begin reading the scientific literature - read the papers I suggest, run a literature search and read papers suggested by this search. Literature searches can be done in PubMed (best for looking for a specific author/combination of keywords), Google Scholar (best for looking for the ‘top’ papers on a topic), or Google (really useful for finding specific factoids).
-	Learn how to plan your experiments.  Make sure your experiments address the question of interest correctly – this includes learning how to do the appropriate controls, techniques, etc. ‘At the Bench’ Chapters 1-6 provide general advice on how to set up your lab space/desk space, keeping a notebook and planning experiments, while Chapters 7-10 provide useful technical background for many of our lab’s main assays. Additionally, Wikipedia or company websites are often great sources of information on how an assay works.You will also need to learn how to effectively plan and multi-task to prevent down times. Develop plans with short/medium/long-term goals.
-	Keep detailed lab notebooks – these are essential to turn your hard work into a finished paper. Your notes should allow your work to be reproduced (meaning they must be understandable by people other than yourself) and will help to assign credit for authorship.  They are required by funding agencies and for any potential patents.  At a minimum each experiment should clearly identify the date, purpose, what you did, the results, and your conclusions. Your bound notebook should establish links to electronic files (such as images) and to print-outs of raw data that are kept in 3-ring binders (such as flow cytometry plots or multi-well plate reader assays). You are required to leave the originals behind when you leave the lab for others to build upon your work. More details can be found in the slides about notebooks.

# You will help to manage the lab
-	You will be responsible for
  -	Overseeing that shared jobs are done
  -	All aspects of lab safety (chemical, biological, bloodborne pathogens)
  -	Ordering and inventory
    -	Regularly check stocks and keep lab supplies organized
    -	Maintain electronic inventories (chem and supply)
    -	Place weekly MDS and credit card orders
  -	Making sure that protocols are kept up to date
  -	Scheduling equipment maintenance (together with the graduate student/post doc who is in charge of that equipment)
  -	Reporting anything to me that needs my attention (lab conflict, equipment problem, etc)
-	As a research specialist, it is expected that you will take a leading role in training new lab personnel – to many people, you will be the ‘go to’ person to field questions. If you are not the best person to help with a particular question, please help them find the right person in the lab.
