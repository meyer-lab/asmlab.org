This work shows that in addition to being a tumor cell-intrinsic resistance factor to ionizing radiation, AXL signaling drives decreased MHC-I abundance and immunosuppressive cytokine expression. The AXL-proximal signaling that drives this effect is not worked out---it would be interesting to know what signaling is involved to determine how specific this is to TAM receptors vs. other kinases.
