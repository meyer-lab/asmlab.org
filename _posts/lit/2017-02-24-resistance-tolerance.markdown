An interesting paper on the relationship between the development of tolerance and resistance. It's in bacteria but surely has direct ties to selectively toxic drugs in cancer as well. They show that tolerance can directly enable rare, resistance-causing mutations to develop. They also come up with an explanation for why tolerance would develop before resistanceâ€”the routes to tolerance are by many different mutational changes, while resistance had a more restrictive set of routes.
