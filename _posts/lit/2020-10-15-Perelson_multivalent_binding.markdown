Our lab has developed a multi-ligand, multi-receptor, multi-valent binding model. It has been utilized to model the [antibody Fc-FcÎ³R interactions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.018) as well as to improve drug selective cell population binding. This classical biophysics work is the original wisdom that inspires our model.
