An interesting paper from a few hospitals, mainly in Boston. They're doing targeted capture and sequencing of a broad panel of patients to try and design therapies around that data. They find focal amplification of AXL in ~1% of patients. AXL inhibitor was tried in one of those patients and gave a striking response.
