Tensor decomposition techniques have been used extensively in many projects in our lab, such as mapping model-predicted common gamma chain cytokine responses, reasoning antigen-specific systems serology data, and improving cancer cell line drug response predictions. To understand tensor decomposition methods, this paper is a good place to start.
