Very interesting approach to disentangle signaling networks using global phosphoproteomic measurements. This novel method infers kinase activity by integrating the scores of two kinase-centric components; overall kinase phosphorylation levels and activation loop phosphorylation, and two substrate-centric components; quantification of experimentally reported kinase-substrate relationships shown in PhosphoSitePlus and levels of kinase substrates predicted by an algorithm–NetworKIN–that performs motif-based predictions to pinpoint kinases responsible for specific phosphorylation events.
