Really relevant work on how the axis AXL-ABL2-TAZ engage in an autocrine positive feedback loop to promote brain metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma. These results suggest that the combination treatment of the AXL inhibitor R428 and the ABL allosteric inhibitor asciminib could be a novel route to block disease progression in AXL-driven lung cancers.
