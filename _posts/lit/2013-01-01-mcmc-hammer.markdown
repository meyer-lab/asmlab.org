A versatile package for Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference that we apply in different contexts for learning about the relationship of a model to experimental data. In contrast to [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) or [STAN](http://mc-stan.org), emcee requires virtually no information about the underlying model, but can run with parallelization.
