We use this process to create our own Luminex assays from standard ELISA reagents. A version of this protocol [can be found on protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/Luminex-Bead-Coupling-kx3wk5).

<h2>Reagents</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Activation buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.3)</li>
    <li>Coupling buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4)</li>
    <li>PBS</li>
    <li>PBS/1% BSA</li>
    <li>EDC (N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide)</li>
    <li>S-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide)</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert info">Minimize the exposure of EDC and S-NHS to air and moisture. Use fresh aliquots for each coupling reaction and discard after use. Pierce sells individually packaged, small amounts of S-NHS that can be used in a single use fashion.</div>


<h2>Procedure</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Vortex the bead stock suspension to yield a homogeneous bead suspension.</li>
    <li>Dissolve approximately 10 mg each of EDC and S-NHS into 2 microcentrifuge tubes and resuspend in deionized water at 50 mg/mL.</li>
    <li>Centrifuge the 100 μl bead suspension for 3 min at 10,000 x g. Carefully discard the supernatant.</li>
    <li>Resuspend the beads in 80 μl activation buffer.</li>
    <li>Add 10 μl of S-NHS solution and 10 μl of EDC solution to the bead suspension. Incubate with agitation for 20 min at room temperature in the dark at roughly 900 rpm.</li>
    <li>Dilute your protein stock solution with coupling buffer to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in a volume of 100 μl.
    Optimal coupling may occur at a concentration within 25-250 μg/ml. Note the protein stock cannot have any other amine groups present.</li>
    <li>Centrifuge the beads for 3 min at 10,000 x g, and carefully remove and discard the supernatant.</li>
    <li>Add the diluted protein solution.</li>
    <li>Agitate the tube with activated beads and protein solution overnight at 4C at roughly 900 rpm in the dark (wrapped in foil).</li>
    <li>Centrifuge the beads for 3 min at 10,000 x g. Discard supernatant.</li>
    <li>Wash the beads three times with PBS/1% BSA.</li>
    <li>Resuspend the bead pellet in 1 ml PBS/1% BSA.</li>
    <li>Determine bead concentration using Luminex and adjust amount of stock used accordingly.</li>
</ul>
