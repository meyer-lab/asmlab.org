This is a consolidation of the code used in <a href="/publications/">Meyer et al</a>. Apologies for the disorganization. The current code is a refinement of roughly three times the amount of code in the form of disorganized scripts written by various parties over many years. Those who would like to use the code can contact me for additional usage help.
