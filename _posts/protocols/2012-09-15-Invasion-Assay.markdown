<div class="alert info">This is a detailed protocol we use for an inverted invasion assay, as used in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/14/1222387110.abstract">Miller et al</a>. </div>

<h2>Before Starting</h2>

<ol>
<li>Spray down and clean hood.</li>
<li>Bring into hood: 20 uL tips, P20 pipette (bench 4), 1.5 mL tubes.</li>
<li>Make 1.5 mL of each growth factor and inhibitor solution 3X concentrated in full serum media (10 tubes).</li>
<li>Set centrifuge to 3C, open and close the lid. Make sure 96-well plate rotors are placed. Allow centrifuge to cool for 20 min.</li>
<li>Remove everything from hood, place tubes in water bath.</li>
<li>Warm PBS, full serum media and trypsin.</li>
</ol>


<h2>During</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bring into hood: 200 μL tips (yellow), 12-channel pipette (bench 6), cell culture P200, 1000 μL tips (blue), P1000 pipette (bench 4), 2-15 mL falcon tubes (one into ice), large square bucket with ice, 10x DMEM (on ice), 1N NaOH (on ice), multichannel reservoirs, warm PBS, warm trypsin. Get a ViCell tube.</li>
<li>Trypsinize a 10 cm plate of cells by washing once with 2 mL PBS and adding 2 mL trypsin.</li>
<li>Once trypsinized, resuspend cells in 8 mL media in the warm falcon tube. Take 1 mL and count on ViCell. Sediment cells at 1260 rpm for 3 min.</li>
<li>Resuspend cells at a concentration of 600k/mL.</li>
<li>Place a reservoir on ice.</li>
<li>Add 600 μL of 10x DMEM, then 108 μL of 1N NaOH to the falcon tube on ice and mix by pipetting.</li>
<li>Using a 5 mL pipette tip, add 3.2 mL of acid extracted collagen and mix with the same tip by pipetting. Vacate the pipette, then wait for residual collagen to settle and vacate again.</li>
<li>Bring black Nunc plates (4°C TC fridge) into the hood, and place one on ice.</li>
<li>Using a 10 mL pipette, add 2 mL of cell solution to the collagen mix then immediately remove the entire solution and place in reservoir. Mix thoroughly using the same pipette.</li>
<li>Immediately dispense 50 μL into each well of the 96-well plate and centrifuge for 8 min at 300×g (g’s are indicated when the speed has a * next to the number).</li>
<li>Place plate in the incubator for 30 min.</li>
<li>Put back everything except for single-channel P200 and tips (yellow). Keep full serum media in water bath.</li>
</ol>

<h3>After</h3>

<ol>
<li>Bring warm inhibitor solutions and media into hood.</li>
<li>Dispense 50 uL of appropriate solution into each well.</li>
<li>Discard remaining inhibitor solutions; put media back in water bath. Wait 1 hr.</li>
<li>Bring warm growth factor solutions and media into hood.</li>
<li>Dispense 50 uL of appropriate solution into each well.</li>
<li>Put away everything.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Next Day</h2>

<h3>Fixation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Warm 4% PFA in PBS (frozen in back right of -20C) in water bath.</li>
<li>Wait until 24 hr after growth factor stimulation.</li>
<li>In fume hood, pour PFA into reservoir; bring 200 μL (yellow) tips and multichannel pipette.</li>
<li>Get plate from incubator. Invert and blot plate on a pad of paper towels to remove media.</li>
<li>Add 100 μL PFA to each well.</li>
<li>Let sit at room temperature for 1 hr.</li>
<li>Discard extra PFA, tips in chemical waste.</li>
<li>In fume hood invert and blot plate on paper towels. Discard paper towels in chemical waste.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Staining</h3>

<ol>
<li>Add 200 μL PBS to each well.</li>
<li>Transfer 10 mL of 0.5% TX-100, 0.5% BSA in PBS (on 4°C non-TC shelf) to a 15 mL falcon tube.</li>
<li>Add 2 μL DRAQ5 (in 4°C secondary box) and mix by inverting.</li>
<li>Empty plate by blotting onto pad of paper towels.</li>
<li>Place solution in reservoir and dispense 100 μL in each well.</li>
<li>Incubate overnight at 4°C.</li>
<li>Empty plate by blotting onto pad of paper towels.</li>
<li>Add 100 uL 0.5% BSA in PBS (on 4C non-TC shelf).</li>
<li>Repeat 7&8 once.</li>
<li>Store at 4°C.</li>
