We use these alternative buffers when performing Luminex assays. We've had only success with them.

* Lysis: 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 10% glycerol; 1% NP40; phosphatase & protease inhibitors
* Alternative lysis: 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA; 1% Triton X100; 0.1% Na Deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; 140 mM NaCl; phosphatase & protease inhibitors
* Wash: 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS
* Assay: 1% BSA in PBS
* Resuspend: PBS
* Antibody dilutent: 1% BSA in PBS
