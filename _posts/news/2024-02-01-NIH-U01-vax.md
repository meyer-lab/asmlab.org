The Meyer lab has received a [new grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10764670) from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This project, working with several other labs at UCLA, will study the durability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in kidney transplant recipients. The Meyer lab will lead the integration of the collected data to find how interactions across the immune system are disrupted by immunosuppressive drugs. Doing so will help to identify how this dysregulation can be corrected to improve responses to vaccination in this and other at-risk populations.
