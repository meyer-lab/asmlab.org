The lab has been awarded [funding](https://csbconsortium.org/?page_id=524) from the [NCI Cancer Systems Biology Consortium](https://csbconsortium.org). This project aims to use systems-level signaling measurements and modeling to determine which lung cancer tumors will respond to AXL inhibitors. The work is in collaboration with the [Haura](http://labpages2.moffitt.org/haura) and [White](http://white-lab.mit.edu) labs.
