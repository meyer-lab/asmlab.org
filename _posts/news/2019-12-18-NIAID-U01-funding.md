The lab has been awarded a grant from the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This project builds on our [model of IgGs binding to effector cells](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.018), to predict the effect of antibody combinations. The work is in collaboration with the [Nimmerjahn](https://www.genetik.nat.uni-erlangen.de/English/research/nimmerjahn.shtml) labs. As part of this funding we will participate in a consortium of labs working to improve antibody engineering, with potential application to many diseases and therapies.
