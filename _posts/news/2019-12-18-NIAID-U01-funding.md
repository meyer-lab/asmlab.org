The lab has been awarded funding from the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This project aims to use systems-level signaling measurements and modeling to determine which lung cancer tumors will respond to AXL inhibitors. The work is in collaboration with the [Nimmerjahn](https://www.genetik.nat.uni-erlangen.de/English/research/nimmerjahn.shtml) labs.
