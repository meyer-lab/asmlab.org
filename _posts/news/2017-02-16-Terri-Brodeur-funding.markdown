The lab has [received funding](https://tbbcf.org/aaron-meyer-phd/) from the [Terri Brodeur Breast Cancer Foundation](https://tbbcf.org). This will enable really critical work to study the [pleiotropic effects of TAM receptors](http://asmlab.org/research/TAM.html) and develop rationally designed inhibitors. Ultimately, this work aims to also help us determine which patients will benefit from these therapies.
