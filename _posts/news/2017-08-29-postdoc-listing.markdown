A postdoctoral associate position is available in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to work in the laboratory of Dr. Aaron Meyer. The Meyer lab is an interdisciplinary academic research team that utilizes combined computational and experimental approaches to better understand cancer cell resistance and innate immune signaling. Multiple projects are available within the scope of the lab’s overall focus. A central goal of the lab is to help its members successfully become independent investigators by providing trainees with a supportive environment, close mentorship, and ample resources.

Applicants should hold a Ph.D. degree in Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Computational Biology, or related quantitative biological sciences field. Must have experience in the following technical areas: computational methods and tools for analysis, and statistics; and biological experience in one of the following: molecular biology, immunology, or cancer biology. Applicants with exceptionally strong quantitative backgrounds but relatively less experience in biological sciences will be considered. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills are highly valued. Seek a highly motivated, independent individual with excellent documentation skills; strong interpersonal skills; and the ability to contribute in a multidisciplinary team setting, prioritize and perform multiple tasks in a dynamic environment, and execute detailed technical protocols meticulously.

Interested applicants should submit a short cover letter and CV to Dr. Meyer (apply@asmlab.org). This should include a short description of the previous project that they are most proud of (science or non-science) and how it reflects the qualities above.
