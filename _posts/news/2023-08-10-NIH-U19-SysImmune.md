The Meyer lab has received a [new grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10551707) from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This project, working with several other labs at UCLA, will study Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Both of these organisms are commonly found on healthy individuals without causing problems, but occasionally lead to deadly infections. The Meyer lab will lead the development of new computational algorithms for pattern matching across datasets, to identify commonalities across different types of measurements and between both types of infections. Doing so will improve our ability to predict the outcome of infection and our understanding of how these infections become life-threatening.
