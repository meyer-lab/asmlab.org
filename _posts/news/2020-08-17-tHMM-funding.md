The lab has been awarded a grant from the [Jayne Koskinas Ted Giovanis Foundation for Health and Policy](https://www.jktgfoundation.org). This will continue support for our work on using [lineage tree-based hidden Markov models](https://github.com/meyer-lab/tHMM) to quantify the heterogeneity of drug response in tumor cell populations. The project is in collaboration with the [Heiser lab at OHSU](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/laura-m-heiser-phd).
