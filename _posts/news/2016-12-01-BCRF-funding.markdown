The lab has received funding from the [Jayne Koskinas Ted Giovanis Foundation for Health and Policy](http://jktgfoundation.org) and the [Breast Cancer Research Foundation](https://www.bcrfcure.org). This will enable work to study the effects of tumor cell plasticity on drug response and resistance, in collaboration with the [Heiser](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/people/laura-heiser.cfm), [Peyton](http://www.peytonlab.org), [Nie](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/qnie/), and [Levy](http://www.math.umd.edu/~dlevy/) labs.
