Congratulations Jackson on winning a best poster award at the [QC Bio retreat](https://qcb.ucla.edu/events-seminars/retreat/)! He presented on how tensor methods can be used to find integrative, multi-omic patterns in MRSA infection, which both improves predictions of patient outcomes and helps to interpret the immunology mechanistically.
